# WORKSHOP ADVANCED WORKFLOW - GULP

An advanced Shopify workflow using Gulp. This is a completely blank theme that gives you a blank canvas to start from. Do not think of this as a starter theme, it is simply a workflow that will allow you to do whatever you want with your front end code.

*Meant to be used with [WorkshopCLI](https://github.com/WorkshopCLI/workshop-cli)*
